# Jaye Johnson - Full Stack Web Developer in Training

I am a Full Stack Web Developer in training currently located in The Bay Area. This is my personal portfolio website that is a work in progress.

I've pulled this fork from the talented [Chelsea Tolnai](https://github.com/ChelseaTolnai/Portfolio), and borrowed code from the talented [Cleiton Correa](https://github.com/CleitonCorrea/my-certifications).

The aim of my portfolio is to highlight my budding experience, skill set, education, projects-to-be, ever-evolving stack, how to reach me, and other details about me.

You can view this current portfolio at the permalink [https://github.com/JayeVAJohnson/Portfolio](https://github.com/JayeVAJohnson/Portfolio).

## About Me

Insightful computer science self-study student who excels at HTML, CSS, and R, getting acquainted Python and so much more. Seeking an entry-level tech role or returnship at a right-fit startup or any-size organization.<br>
<br>I am in a unique position of having learned the skill sets mentioned below while on the job and having worked on behalf of others (as a transcriptionist and data science project assistant among other roles). Therefore, I have come to realize I need to find more ways to better illsutrate my self-taught technical knowledge more demonstrable. This is why there is a delay in my certification process -- I'd simply been learning and applying these skills on the job.
