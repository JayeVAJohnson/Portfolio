# Jaye Johnson - Full Stack Web Developer in Training

I am a Full Stack Web Developer in training currently located in The Bay Area. This is my personal portfolio website that is a work in progress.

I've pulled this fork from the talented [Chelsea Tolnai](https://github.com/ChelseaTolnai/Portfolio), and borrowed code from the talented [Cleiton Correa](https://github.com/CleitonCorrea/my-certifications).

I am still in the process of editing this page.

The aim of this is to highlight my budding experience, skill set, education, projects-to-be, ever-evolving stack, how to reach me, and details about me.

You can view my current portfolio at [https://github.com/JayeVAJohnson/Portfolio](https://github.com/JayeVAJohnson/Portfolio).
